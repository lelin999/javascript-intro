Chapter 2: Higher Order Functions

Whenever you see:
//   CODE GOES HERE   // //   CODE GOES HERE   // //   CODE GOES HERE   //,
delete that code and write your code there.
Follow the instructions and stop when you see a giant code block that tells you to stop.
When you're done with the entire lesson, run the code in Node.

Try your BEST to use ES6 syntax. Let/Const vs var. Arrow functions, etc.

Keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). If you created a function before, utilize that to make your life easier.



Higher order functions are functions that take in another function as a callback
                                                                                                                                                                    */
